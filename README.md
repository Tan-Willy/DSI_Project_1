## Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on your exploration of the data, what are you key takeaways and recommendations? Choose one state with a lower participation rate and provide a suggestion for how the College Board might increase participation amongst graduating seniors in this state. Are there additional data you desire that would better inform your investigations?

The key takeaway is that after studying and investigating the reasons why Illinois and Colorado have a sudden spike in the participation rate for 2018 SAT is because they have decided to switch all high schoolers to take the required SAT and the test is paid by the states. But this also resulted in the drop of the total score of SAT for both states. In the case of Illinois, the state shifted to SAT and are paid for but there are still people taking ACT. Even though the participation rate for ACT that year was not high, the scores were actually higher than previous year because those taking the ACT were most likely preparing for college. After researching on which state to recommend from our initial 5, California, New Mexico, Texas, Oregon and Alaska, we have chosen California. The data that we have gathered and analysed on were from 2017 and 2018. We did not include 2019's data as the year has not ended and using the existing 2019 data will be incomplete to have a more accurate findings.
